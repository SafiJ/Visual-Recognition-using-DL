## Before using

### File, Folder placing
Remember to place the file -> HW1.ipynba, folder -> training_data, testing_data in the same folder.

### Path setting
Set the path correctly, if you use this on google colab you won't have to do anything about path

### Pytorch version setting
*torch version should be at least 1.7.0+cu101

## Usage
The code is a .ipynb file. So Download the HW1 folder and click 'Run All' will run the pretrained model and generate result.csv file which has 91.86% accuracy.
